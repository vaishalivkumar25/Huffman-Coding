# Huffman Coding
In the first step of the project, Binary Heap, 4-way cache optimized heap and Pairing Heap were used as priority queue
to develop a program to generate Huffman codes and evaluate the one giving the best performance. Pairing heap was
identified to give the best performance. In the second part of the project Pairing heap was used as priority queue to
design encoder and decoder. The input to the encoder is given in the form of a text file and the output is a binary file
which is given as input to the decoder to decode the encoded data. The project was developed in JAVA.
